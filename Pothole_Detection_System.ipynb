Unlike traditional manual inspections, this system ensures real-time, scalable monitoring using trained YOLO models on diverse datasets. It empowers civic bodies with actionable insights to prioritize repairs, improve road safety, and optimize maintenance resources. Designed for urban infrastructure resilience, the system integrates seamlessly with GIS platforms and mobile/web dashboards. Its adaptability to different terrains and lighting conditions makes it a cutting-edge asset for smart city initiatives.\n",

        "YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies and localizes multiple objects within an image in a single pass through the neural network. Unlike traditional methods that require multiple stages, YOLO processes the entire image at once, making it extremely fast and efficient. It divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each cell simultaneously. This unified architecture makes YOLO ideal for time-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and surveillance. Its latest versions (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, etc.) offer enhanced accuracy, speed, and model flexibility."

By leveraging YOLO's real-time image processing capabilities, the system can accurately detect and localize potholes from road images or video feeds in a single pass. The process involves collecting and annotating a diverse dataset, training the YOLO model for high-precision detection, and deploying it on edge devices or integrated dashboards. This solution replaces manual inspections with automated, scalable monitoring—empowering authorities with timely insights for maintenance planning. Its speed, accuracy, and adaptability make it a valuable tool for smart transportation systems."
